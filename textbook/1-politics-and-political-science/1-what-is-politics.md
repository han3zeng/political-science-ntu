### Biological

### Psychological
* Psyhololgical studies has shown that most people are naturally conformist
    * Milgram study
        * note: I don't agree study shows that people are naturally conformist. Say most student has been indoctrinated about the authority of professor and influenced by norm, beliefs that you have to repsect professor. So "slaves" will basically agree with whatever the master say but if you put a bunch of professors in to test maybe most of them will no push the button.

### Irrational
* Based on the power to use fear and myth to cloud reason.
    * politics become manipulation of symbols
