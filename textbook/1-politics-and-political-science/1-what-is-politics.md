## Political Power

    * power in politics (Political Power)
        * shape others behavior
        * is getting people to do something they wouldn't otherwise do -- and sometimes having them think it was their idea
        * the ability of one person to get others to do his or her bidding.

## Why some people hold political power over others
### Biological
* human by nature is political animal
* forming a political system and obeying its leaders are innate
    * counter argument: some people disobey authority
        * question: which circumstances promote or undermine the formation of political groups.

### Psychological
* Psychological studies has shown that most people are naturally conformist
    * Milgram study
        * note: I don't agree study shows that people are naturally conformist. Say most student has been indoctrinated about the authority of professor and influenced by norm, beliefs that you have to respect professor. So "slaves" will basically agree with whatever the master say but if you put a bunch of professors in to test maybe most of them will not push the button.

### Cultural
* Human behavior that is learned as opposed to inherited
    * value + belief -> culture -> political community
        * to spread or even push people to follow your thought
    * optimism
        * believe that people's bad behavior can be altered by education

### Rational
* People know what they want
    * To safeguard life and property, people form governments. If those governments become abusive, the people have the right to dissolve them and start anew - John Locke
        * American are influenced by John Locke fundamentally

* note
    * rational reason is a more convincing and proper reason for people to form political power.
        * ruler will not control power and fool people
        * ruler has to consider opinions of people

### Irrational
* Based on the power to use fear and myth to cloud reason.
    * politics become manipulation of symbols


## Power as Composite
### Overview
* biological + psychological + culture + rational + irrational
* legitimacy
    * mass feeling that the government's rule is rightful and should be obeyed
* Power is earned not seized -> need legitimacy

### Is power identical to politics?
#### politics is goal + policies
    * goals + policies
        * need power to achieve them
* power

#### politics === struggle for power

    * dangerous thought

* "Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely." - Lord Acton

## Concept and Percept
* "Percepts without concepts are empty, and concepts without percepts are blind" - Immanuel Kant
    * percept
        * perceive through sensory organs
            * facts, images, numbers, examples, etc.
    * concept
        * theory, idea, hypotheses, beliefs, etc

## My Conclusion
* What is politics
    * politics is a competition for power so that individual or group can shape norm, symbol, value, belief in society. Eventually, the individual or group can make people to do that they want and eventually people will believe what they are doing is what they want
