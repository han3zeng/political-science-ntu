## Theoretical Frameworks

### Behavioralism
* Three main viewpoints
    * traditional
        * abstract, concept
    * behavioral
        * data driven
    * postbehavioral
        * combine traditional and behavorial viewpoints

* cause
    * focus more on **institutions**
        * the formal structures of government
            * constitution (not practical, only get abstract concept)
              * result: good constitution but fail
                  * Soviet Union -> dictatorship
                  * Germany's Weimar Republic
* consequence
    * need to focus more on practical implementations -> Behavioralism

* Behavioralism

    * positivism
    * more about
        * quantitative data
        * empirical study

            * scientific observation
    * less about
        * intuition or specultion
    * feature
        * social(citizen)-base questions
        * examples
