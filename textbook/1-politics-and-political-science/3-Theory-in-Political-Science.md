# Theory in Political Science
## Theory
* facts without theory are just meaningless and useless
    * facts with theory -> coherent whole.
* Theory
    1. help your to ask right questions in right order
    2. Theories are tested with observations
    3. Theories are suggestions as to how the facts should be organized

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Behavioralism
* Three main viewpoints
    * traditional
        * abstract, concept
    * behavioral
        * data-driven
    * post-behavioral
        * combine traditional and behavioral viewpoints

* cause
    * traditionalism focus more on **institutions**
        * the formal structures of government
            * constitution (not practical, only get abstract concept)
              * result: good constitution but fail
                  * Soviet Union -> dictatorship
                  * Germany's Weimar Republic
* consequence
    * need to focus more on practical implementations -> Behavioralism

* Behavioralism
    * focus more on how politics really worked, not how it was supposed to worked
    * positivism
    * more about
        * quantitative data
        * empirical study
            * valid data
            * scientific observation
    * less about
        * institution or speculation
    * feature
        * social(citizen)-base questions
        * examples
            * survey + data
                * public opinion
                * votes in legislatures
                * election
                * voting patterns
    * disadvantages
        * static
        * conservative
        * irrelevant to the urgent tasks
        * current situation === norm
            * exam only exist situation
                * established democratic systems
            * prefer status quo
                * neglect possibility of change
        * narrow scope
            * steer clear from big picture
                * example
                    * care about how citizens vote but neglect how voting pattern of citizens relate to how elected officials make decisions
### Post-Behavioral
* synthesis of traditional, behavioral approaches
    * traditional (value)
        * qualitative data
            * history
            * philosophy
    * behavioral (fact)
        * quantitative data
            * public opinion
            * rational-choice theory

## New Institutionalism
* goal
    * enhance and preserve existing institution
* move from behavioralism to focus more on institutions
    * however, the institutions are comprised with two main elements
        1. rule base
        2. citizen opinions (create new law to reflect opinions of citizens )

## System Theory
* postwar political system - David Easton
    * Benefit
        * simplify reality
        * easy to understand
    * flaw
        * depart from reality

### Original model of political system
* Diagram
    1. input
        * citizens
            * Demands
            * Apathy
            * Supports
    2. Conversion Process
        * inputs are recognized by following
            * Government
            * Decision Makers
    3. outputs
        * gov
            * Decision and actions
        * impact
            * Social
            * Economic
            * Political Environment
    4. citizens feedback
    5. back to first step

* Examples
    * Simplify Reality
        * The Nixon administration end the draft in 1973
            * feedback from citizens
    * Depart from reality
        * gov do not care the feedback of citizens
            * Hitler's German Government
            * Soviet Bloc
    * Can't explain
        * Vietnam war
            * American do not require the gov to participate Vietnam War

### Modified Model of Political System
* Diagram
    1. Government + Decision Makers + Withinputs
        * Withinputs (short circuit in gov)
            * pressure from different parts of gov
                * lobbyists
                * political scientist
                * legislaturers
    2. outputs
        * Decisions and actions
        * impact
            * Social
            * Economic
            * Political Environment
    3. Results
    4. Inputs
        * Demands
        * Apathy
        * Supports
    5. feedback
    6. back to first step

* example
    * Afghanistan War
        * initiated by gov and is supported by citizens. Later on, citizens opposed the expensive occupation so gov try to withdraw troops from Afghanistan
### Rational-Choice Theory
* Rational-Choice theorists argue that one can generally predict political behavior by knowing the interests of the actors involved because they rationally maximize their interests.
    * all actors are rational
* game-theory


## People
* Auguste Comte
    * positivism
* David Easton
    * model of political system


## Questions
* what is rational choice exactly
