## Can Politics be Studied as a Science ?
* what is science
    * science is a method not a certain subject
    * science in french === knowledge
    * misunderstood => science === natural science
        * measurement + calculation

* Political Science === Natural Science
    * gather quantified data and validate hypothesis
        * flaw
            * most decisions made by power circle is hard to understand and are full of secrecy

* Political Science
    * Politics is an empirical discipline.
        * quantified + qualitative data
            * pattern
                * generalization
                    * theory
                        * law


## They Struggle to See Clearly
* study the issues as they are not as what we wish them to be
    * I study without I but with my role
* The spirit of **scholarship** can prevent subjective bias.

### Scholarship
* Reasoned
    * spell out youe reasoning
        * spell out underlying assumption
* Balanced
    * admit your view is one among several
* Supported with Evidence
    * two types of evidence
        1. quntified evidence of natural science
        2. qualitatived evidence of the humanilities
    * need primary source
        * secondary sourec (cited paper)
* Theoretical
    * the brand new theory is not always necessary needed
        * the minimum: the theoretical point should at least confrim or refute an existing theory.
        * need pratical factors + emprical evidence
    * pattern: "Most of time there is C there is also D, and here's probably why."
    * ex:
        * Denounce people who join Islamic State with gusto (x)
        * Study why people join Islamic State(v)
            * There are a lot of poeple join Islamic State in 2015, and here's probabaly why.

    * some stories are about politics
    * focus on unique events
        * what happen
        * why happen
* History
    * past
    * some study focuses on politics
    * focus on unique events
        * what happened
        * why happened
* Political Science
    * try to generalize events
        * generalize
            * Explaining the causes of consequences of a whole class of events
    * comparison
        * compare multiple revolutions together
        * what factors cause revolutions
        * why success or fail
        * consequences of revolution
* Note
    * Historians and journalists are tend to focus on specific event, person, whereas political scientists are more interested in forming generalization, e.g., what cause revolution; the most common consequences of revolution; how a new strategy for the international response to a refugee crises led to a 50 percent increase in the number of refugees.
